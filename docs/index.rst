Introduction
------------
`PyQrack <https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack>`_ is a pure Python `ctypes` wrapper on the C++11 `Qrack <https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack>`_ library, for quantum computing simulation.


An introductory talk to Qrack can be found here `Intro to Qrack: a framework for fast quantum simulation by Daniel Strano | Quantum Software Talks <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxyqJDC4SUo>`_.
